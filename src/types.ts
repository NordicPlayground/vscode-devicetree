The alias node shall be at the root of the devicetree and have the node name /aliases. Each property of the /aliases node defines an alias. The property name specifies the alias name. The property value specifies the full path to a node in the devicetree. For example, the property serial0 = "/simple-bus@fe000000/ serial@llc500" defines the alias serial0. Alias names shall be a lowercase text strings of 1 to 31 characters from the following set of characters.\n\nAn alias value is a device path and is encoded as a string. The value represents the full path to a node, but the path does not need to refer to a leaf node. A client program may use an alias property name to refer to a full device path as all or part of its string value. A client program, when considering a string as a device path, shall detect and use the alias.`,
